This dashboard provides an interactive exploration on GDP and life expectancy over time and by country, the goal is to show relationships between these two variables.

**Steps followed:**

1. Imported CSV datasets into PBI Desktop
2. Used Power Query for data for ETL process.
3. Created helper tables to establish relationships between both datasets, thus creating dynamic filtering.
4. Created measures to calculate average life expectancy for Male, Females and both Sexes combined.
5. Added diverse charts, such as line chart, bar chart, and a world map for fun exploration.
